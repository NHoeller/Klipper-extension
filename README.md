# Klipper

### Introduction
I made this repository, because i wanted to create a universal configuration system for Klipper that i can use for my current and future printers. In the first step i am going to create a folder structure with main options like
[ ] folder structure
[ ] neopixel
[ ] resonance-tester
[ ] door-lock-controls
[ ] temperature-controls
[ ] mini-display (if 2nd dispplay is implemented in klipper)
[ ] start-pause-resume-end macros
[ ] bed-leveling-controls
These features will be placed in several seperat files and one or more master files.
To do changes one needs only to access the master files.

In the next step i will try to make suggestions to the Klipper-, Mainsail-, Fluidd- and Octoprint-community to bring some minor and major upgrades so a configuration with dependencies and/or a variable-based configuration can be implemented in klipper.

In the last step i will try to suggest additional functions, so one can do almost every change in the configuration guided by a webUI integrated in the mainsail-, fluidd- and octoprint webGUI.

For further details follow this repository and check this README.md
